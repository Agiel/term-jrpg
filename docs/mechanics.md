# Mechanics
The game's focus is on having unique characters with distinct skills and mechanics, as well as a high degree of synergizing between them in order to make mixing up the party composition more interesting.

## Characters
Each character will have their own unique skill tree, out of which a limited number of skills can be equipped at one time. Players will have to come up with party and skill compositions that effectively exploit or create weaknesses of the enemies encountered in any given level.

Skills drain or generate resources that are unique to each character. For example, the gunslinger has a limited number of bullets in his guns (although the ammo pool is unlimited) which means that some turns will be spent reloading. To avoid wasting turns skills will need to be chained in such a way that reloading isn't done until he's out of bullets. The Technopriest generates prayers through self-sacrifice; spend prayers on skills like taunt to attract enemy attacks, which in turn generates more prayers.

Characters also have a basic attack (or action) that can be used when out of resources, but with optimized builds this will become less and less relevant as the characters level up.

## Skill design
Skills should almost always do more than one thing. I.e. skills don't only deal damage but also add a status effect and/or drain or generate some resource. The additional effect or damage multiplier can be conditioned on some status effect existing on the target, which means players need to think about in which order to play their available skills. Damage can also come in different elemental forms which enemies will be either strong or weak to.
