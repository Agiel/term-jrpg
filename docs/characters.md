# Character Concepts
## Gunslinger
**Resources:** Ammo

Gun-Kata ala Equilibrium. Skills require some number of bullets, melee attack reloads. There may also be a small number of skills that reload.

## Netrunner
**Resources:** RAM, Heat

DoTs and CC. RAM is used up while enemy is affected by status effect. Tradeoff between focusing a single target or spreading out. Processing power (i.e. damage) is throttled if heat rises too high. Melee attacks and select skills dissipate heat.

## Technopriest
**Resources:** Prayers

Main tank, paladin. Build up prayers by taking hits or using melee attacks. Skills consume prayers.

## Clairvoyant
**Resources:** Sun, Moon

Tarot themed. Keep sun and moon charges balanced for increased crit damage. Skills that delay enemy turns or let teammates play immediately.

## Nanovampire
**Resources:** Nanobots (battery)

"Supersoldier" injected with self-replicating nanobots. Healing and using powerful skills drain the battery. Melee and some skills recharge it. E.g. a skill might cost 30% to latch onto a target and then CC for three rounds, gaining 33% each round.
